# PatchWork
## Status
**Work in progress**

## Introduction
For Etsy sellers, there's constantly a need to understand your market, and more importantly, *your place in that market*. PatchWork is being designed to use social network analysis to help sellers understand their position in their market and suggest ways to improve that position to increase sales and gain customers.

For now, this is just a concept, but progress will be posted here, so check back later. Any questions, contact matthew.a.hoover at gmail.com.
